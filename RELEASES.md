# Release notes

## `0.1.1` (20181028)

* No more need to `source` the script because the script will start a new `bash`
  shell where the envirinment variables will be available because they are
  inherited from the parent shell where you started `assumerole`
* Command line completion for the account names, but this requires your
  `~/.bash_profile` to be changed. See `README.md` for details.
